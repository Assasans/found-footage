# Found Footage

**MyceliumNetworking library is required.**

Mod that adds real lost footage from other players to your Old World. Anyone can contribute their own recordings, no curated lists or agreements.

This mod must be installed for **all players** in a team for the best experience.  
To **upload footage**, the lobby host player must have the mod installed.  
You must have the mod installed to **interact** with lost cameras and view recordings.

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION

This mod sends your in-game camera footage to the server __along with audio__, depending on the mod's configuration.  
You can request your data or have it removed, see configuration file for more information.

## Gameplay

You can find lost cameras in the Old World. These contain footage of other players who were there before you.  
You put them into an extraction machine like a normal camera.  
Note that these recordings **will not give you any views or money**.

The mod is experimental, bugs may occur, please report them to a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Assasans/found-footage/issues) if you can.
